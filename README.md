# Ardublockly Menu

Ardublockly Menu is a new version of [Ardublockly](https://github.com/carlosperate/ardublockly) by [Carlos Pereira](https://github.com/carlosperate) adapted for Arduino projects based on Control Interface with LCD Menus.

With this tool, we can create an interface [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) ( Model View Controller ) and defining our custom Options to control different elements connected with Arduino.

## Libraries needed
* [ArduinoMenu Library](https://github.com/neu-rah/ArduinoMenu) - Menu Structure
* [LiquidCrystal](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/LiquidCrystal) - LCD Screen
* [LcdProgressBar](https://github.com/wloche/LcdProgressBar) - Loading Animation for LCD
* [Chrono](https://github.com/SofaPirate/Chrono) - Chronometer and Clock Integration

## Â¿What is Ardublockly?
Ardublockly is a visual programming editor for Arduino. It is based on Google's [Blockly][1], which has been forked to generate [Arduino][15] code.

With Ardublockly, students can drag and visualize at the same time how the code is constructing the sketch.
In addition, blocks are useful to save time with syntax errors in c++ code language, so we can implement faster programs for our Arduino projects. 

The `ArdublocklyServer` Python package initialises a local server to be able to compile and load the Arduino code using the [Arduino IDE][2].
